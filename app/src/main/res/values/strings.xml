    <string name="overview">
        The tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, has held onto its title since 2010. Other entires on the list of the world tallest buildings include the Shanghai Tower, the Abraj Al-Bait, and the Ping An International Finance Centre.
Whether it be due to innovation or land scarcity, the expansion of towns and cities has increased at a very vertical rate in recent years. In fact, there seems to be a great deal of competition between cities to see who can build the world most impressive supertalls. Having the world tallest building can bring tourism revenue and glory to its host city, although it is not a title that many cities hold on to for very long. When it comes to skyscrapers, world trends are changing. North America used to have 75 percent of the tallest buildings 20 years ago, but this has shifted to Asia and the Middle East today. Thanks to the marvel of modern engineering that is ever-changing with the times, buildings keep growing higher, higher, and higher.
